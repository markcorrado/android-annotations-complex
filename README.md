android-annotations-complex
===========================

This project is a deeper dive into Android Annotations and exploring some of the higher level features.

Features used so far:

-Gradle for build automation.  Check out http://www.gradle.org/ for details

-Spring for Android.  Required to use REST Apis.  http://projects.spring.io/spring-android/

-Jackson for data processing.  https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson

-Ormlite for a data model(SQlite).  http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml

I have also built a rails test server for bouncing data off of that I'll add when it's a little more refined.
